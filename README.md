# User Guide
## Introduction

The Reading Assistant is an advanced GPT-4-based tool designed to help you better understand complex texts. It analyzes texts, identifies key concepts, and provides detailed insights to facilitate the reading and understanding of challenging material.

## How It Works

1. **Text Input**: Start by giving the Reading Assistant a text to analyze. If no text is inputted, you will be prompted to do so.
2. **Text Analysis**: After text input, the GPT performs a comprehensive analysis, which includes:
    - **Main Point**: Summarization of the main argument or central thesis of the text.
    - **Concepts**: Listing of seven key concepts or technical terms.
    - **Kinds**: Listing of seven categories of mentioned elements.
    - **Summary**: Detailed division of the text into seven main themes.

## User Interaction

You can interact with the Reading Assistant to dive deeper into the text:

- **c**: Concept exploration. For example, the command "c2 100" provides a detailed explanation of the second concept in 100 words.
- **k**: Details of categories. For example, "k3" lists all elements of the third category.
- **s**: Extended summary. For example, "s4 50" provides a 50-word expansion of the fourth summary point.
- **e**: Extending lists. For example, "ce 10" extends the concept list by ten additional entries, and "ke 5" extends the category list by five additional entries.
- **q**: Generating questions. For example, "q 12" generates twelve questions for flashcards.
- **f**: Creating flashcards. For example, "f1,3,7" creates flashcards for questions 1, 3, and 7.

## Best Practices for the Reading Assistant

### Step 1: Utilizing Combined Commands

1. **Effective Approach**: After the initial analysis, identify relevant areas for deeper explanations.
2. **Command Chains**: Formulate your requests in the form of command chains, separated by semicolons (e.g., "c5 500; k2.3 200; ..."). This allows for a more comprehensive and efficient response from the Reading Assistant.
3. **Extensive Responses**: Be prepared to enter "continue please" for longer command chains to receive the entire response.

### Step 2: Free Questioning

1. **Understanding Questions**: If you encounter ambiguities or challenging content, do not hesitate to ask for explanations. These questions can relate to specific passages, concepts, or arguments in the conversation so far. Asking seemingly "simple" questions is helpful as they often lead to deeper understanding.
2. **Connection to Prior Knowledge and Interests**: Link the content of the text with your own prior knowledge or areas of interest. Ask about parallels, differences, or connections between the text and topics you are familiar with or particularly interested in. This helps anchor new knowledge in your memory.
3. **Inconsistencies**: If something appears inconsistent or unclear, ask for further explanation or clarification. Often, enormous potentials for understanding are hidden here, because one has misunderstood or only half understood something.
4. **Questions about Text Structure and Argumentation**: Inquire about the 'why' behind individual points, how they fit into the overall structure of the text, what role they play, and how the various parts work together to support the main point.
5. **Connection to Other Areas of Knowledge**: Ask questions that place the text in a broader knowledge or research context. Inquire about similarities or differences to other works, theories, or studies. This not only extends your understanding of the current text but also your general knowledge.
6. **Exploration of Implications and Applications**: Request the generation of concrete applications for abstract topics, either through examples hidden in the text or through examples invented by the Reading Assistant.
7. **Additional Tips**:
    1. **Question Chains**: Ask several, perhaps even all your questions at once; the Reading Assistant will then process them step by step.
    2. **Answer Detail**: Specify the desired detail for each question in a preferred word count to prevent answers that are too long or too short.
    3. **Voice Input**: As there will likely be many questions and detailed inquiries, it's best to use the voice input feature in the ChatGPT app instead of the ChatGPT version on the internet.
8. **Extensive Responses**: Be prepared to enter "continue please" for longer chains of questions to receive all the answers.

### Step 3: Creating Flashcards

1. **Flashcard Software**: Use flashcard software like Anki if you want to better anchor what you've learned and have the Reading Assistant generate flashcards relevant to the conversation's content.
2. **Flashcard Generation**: Create flashcards either by generating questions with the "q" command and then with the "f" command.
3. **Free Flashcard Creation**: Or create them by going through the conversation log to formulate relevant questions that the Reading Assistant then turns into flashcards.
4. **Effective Design**: Limit the content and number of flashcards to ensure effective learning. It is advised to instruct the Reading Assistant to limit itself to a maximum of five bullet points per flashcard, with a maximum of seven words per bullet point. Over the course of a week, a maximum of 50 new flashcards should be added.

### Additional Tips

1. **Links**: Save the link to the conversation log to refer back to it later.
2. **Long-Term Benefits**: Stored links to conversations with the Reading Assistant open up a huge potential. You can retrieve relevant information from previously read texts through targeted questions. This can be useful in conversations, when writing scientific papers, or simply when delving deeper into certain topic areas.
3. **Skipping Reading**: Often, reading can be skipped and replaced by a conversation with the Reading Assistant.
4. **YouTube Transcripts**: The content of one or more hour-long YouTube videos can be comfortably assimilated with the Reading Assistant.
5. **Preparation and Follow-Up**: If you still want to read a text or watch a YouTube video, use the Reading Assistant beforehand to get an overview and afterward for deeper questions and contextualizations.
